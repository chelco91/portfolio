##PWP M.S. 1 Feedback
Awesome Milestone 1 - everything is complete, and exceeds expectations. Your code is 100% standards compliant and correct. Great job - awesome styling. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/)

###Suggestions
Although everything is working properly, be careful in the future when loading your Google Fonts after your custom stylesheet. Custom styles *may* need Google Fonts to be loaded first. And always before any &lt;script&gt; tags. [Read More](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/technical_considerations)

###Milestone 3 Feedback
Your wireframes are really nice, but the mobile view is missing. Deploy your project to your A Small Orange Host. Overall great job. Your Milestone 3 passes at Tier II.
 
##Suggestions
- Explore parallax plugins. [Skrollr]("http://prinzhorn.github.io/skrollr/") and [Stellar.js]("http://markdalgleish.com/projects/stellar.js/") are two options
- Take a look at Bootstrap's [Scrollspy]("http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#scrollspy") plugin
- Look into WebGL and canvas for your animations.
