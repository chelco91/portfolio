##PWP M.S. 1 Feedback
Awesome Milestone 1 - everything is complete, and exceeds expectations. Your code is 100% standards compliant and correct. Great job - awesome styling. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/)

###Suggestions
Although everything is working properly, be careful in the future when loading your Google Fonts after your custom stylesheet. Custom styles *may* need Google Fonts to be loaded first. And always before any &lt;script&gt; tags. [Read More](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/technical_considerations)

###Milestone 3 Feedback
Your wireframes are really nice, but the mobile view is missing. Deploy your project to your A Small Orange Host. Overall great job. Your Milestone 3 passes at Tier II.
 
##Suggestions
- Explore parallax plugins. [Skrollr](http://prinzhorn.github.io/skrollr/) and [Stellar.js](http://markdalgleish.com/projects/stellar.js/) are two options
- Take a look at Bootstrap's [Scrollspy](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#scrollspy) plugin
- Look into WebGL and canvas for your animations.

###Milestone 4 Feedback
- Topher, it looks like the bulk of this code was copied and pasted from some other source. This is an awesome layout, and can be done easily in Bootstrap, but it looks like a total pain and time-waster to try and re-engineer it the way it is currently - especially concerning responsiveness. Let me know if I can be of help.
